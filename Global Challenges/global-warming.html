              >Global warming, the gradual heating of Earth's surface, oceans
              and atmosphere, is caused by human activity, primarily the burning
              of fossil fuels that pump carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and other
              greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</summary

            <p>
              Despite political controversy about climate change, a major report
              released Sept. 27, 2013, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
              Change (IPCC) stated that scientists are more certain than ever of
              the link between human activities and global warming. More than
              197 international scientific organizations agree that global
              warming is real and has been caused by human action. <br /><br />
              Already, global warming is having a measurable effect on the
              planet.
              <br /><br />
              "We can observe this happening in real time in many places. Ice is
              melting in both polar ice caps and mountain glaciers. Lakes around
              the world, including Lake Superior, are warming rapidly — in some
              cases faster than the surrounding environment.<br /><br />
              Animals are changing migration patterns and plants are changing
              the dates of activity," such as trees budding their leaves earlier
              in the spring and dropping them later in the fall, Josef Werne, a
              professor of geology and environmental science at the University
              of Pittsburgh, told Live Science.
              <br /><br />
              One of the most immediate and obvious effects of global warming is
              the increase in temperatures around the world. The average global
              temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8
              degrees Celsius) over the past 100 years, according to the
              National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).<br /><br />

              Since record keeping began in 1895, the hottest year on record
              worldwide was 2016, according to NOAA and NASA data. That year
              Earth's surface temperature was 1.78 degrees F (0.99 degrees C)
              warmer than the average across the entire 20th century.
              <br /><br />
              Before 2016, 2015 was the warmest year on record, globally. And
              before 2015? Yep, 2014. In fact, 16 of the 17 warmest years on
              record have happened since 2001, according to NASA.<br /><br />

              For the contiguous United States and Alaska, 2016 was the
              second-warmest year on record and the 20th consecutive year that
              the annual average surface temperature exceeded the 122-year
              average since record keeping began, according to NOAA.

              of climate change. More frequent and intense drought, storms, heat

              Sea levels are rising and oceans are becoming warmer. Longer, more
              intense droughts threaten crops, wildlife and freshwater supplies.
              From polar bears in the Arctic to marine turtles off the coast of
              Africa, our planet’s diversity of life is at risk from the
              changing climate. <br /><br />
              Climate change poses a fundamental threat to the places, species
              and people’s livelihoods WWF works to protect. To adequately
              address this crisis we must urgently reduce carbon pollution and
              prepare for the consequences of global warming, which we are
              already experiencing. WWF works to:

            <summary

              too afraid to ask.</summary
            >
            <p>
              Since the Industrial Revolution, the global annual temperature has
              increased in total by a little more than 1 degree Celsius, or
              about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year that accurate
              recordkeeping began—and 1980, it rose on average by 0.07 degrees
              Celsius (0.13 degrees Fahrenheit) every 10 years. Since 1981,
              however, the rate of increase has more than doubled: For the last
              40 years, we’ve seen the global annual temperature rise by 0.18
              degrees Celsius, or 0.32 degrees Fahrenheit, per decade.
              <br /><br />
              The result? A planet that has never been hotter. Nine of the 10
              warmest years since 1880 have occurred since 2005—and the 5
              warmest years on record have all occurred since 2015. Climate
              change deniers have argued that there has been a “pause” or a
              “slowdown” in rising global temperatures, but numerous studies,
              including a 2018 paper published in the journal Environmental
              Research Letters, have disproved this claim. The impacts of global
              warming are already harming people around the world.
              <br /><br />
              Now climate scientists have concluded that we must limit global
              warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040 if we are to avoid a future
              in which everyday life around the world is marked by its worst,
              most devastating effects: the extreme droughts, wildfires, floods,
              tropical storms, and other disasters that we refer to collectively
              as climate change. These effects are felt by all people in one way
              or another but are experienced most acutely by the
              underprivileged, the economically marginalized, and people of
              color, for whom climate change is often a key driver of poverty,
              displacement, hunger, and social unrest.
