              The blend of revanchism and conspiracism seen in America’s Capitol
              riots is crossing borders. On February 22nd the secretary-general
              of the UN, António Guterres, called white-supremacist terrorism “a
              grave and growing danger”.
            </summary>
            <p>
              GINA BISIGNANO cut an unusual figure among the rioters on January
              6th. Not many chose to storm the Capitol dressed in Chanel boots,
              a Louis Vuitton sweater and fashionable sunglasses. Yet the
              transition undergone by the owner of Gina’s Eyelashes and Skincare
              in Beverly Hills from citizen to insurrectionist is symbolic of
              the coalition responsible for the riot. According to a Beverly
              Hills Courier article, based on interviews with Ms Bisignano,
              before 2016 there was little notable about her political beliefs
              beyond a staunch opposition to abortion. Then she became
              increasingly concerned about paedophiles controlling the
              government. When the pandemic struck she began to attend weekly
              anti-lockdown rallies and grew vocal in her support of Donald
              Trump. When he encouraged people to come to Washington, DC to
              contest the certification of the presidential election he had
              lost, she tweeted back “I’ll be there”. Ms Bisigano's
              conspiratorial thinking and diehard Trump support set the stage
              for her to act as a mouthpiece for the insurrectionist fantasies
              of the far right. When the building was breached, she raised her
              megaphone to urge “strong, angry patriots to help” those inside
              the building, declaring: “This is 1776.” <br /><br />
              Ms Bisignano’s story may seem uniquely American—she did, after
              all, storm the American legislature with the encouragement of a
              defeated American president. But the far right’s strength has been
              growing globally, too. Between 2015 and 2020, according to a UN
              report, the number of far-right attacks around the world more than
              tripled.

            The challenges and opportunities of preventing violent extremism
            through development
          </h2>
          <details>
            <summary
              >Fragile and conflict-afflicted countries provide conditions
              conducive to violent extremism. Conflict-afflicted countries
              suffer greater levels of violent extremism than more stable
              environments, and in turn, violent extremism can feed and deepen
              existing conflict.
            </summary>
            <p>
              Violence, violent extremism and conflict threaten development. The
              2011 ‘World Bank Development Report’ concludes that violence in
              its many forms is the main constraint to meeting the Millennium
              Development Goals. As a result, the 2015 Sustainable Development
              Goals (SDGs) include a specific goal relating to violence,
              justice, and peace. <br /><br />
              Development actors are under intense pressure from the
              international donor community to address violent extremism and
              work more closely with the security sector. Traditionally,
              development and security actors have had little interaction on
              this issue. How, and to what extent, countries should develop a
              long-term development response against what is perceived to be a
              pressing security threat is an urgent policy question.
              <br /><br />
              THE CHALLENGES
              <br /><br />
              Development responses to violent extremism are increasingly
              associated with the term Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE) to
              describe how longer term development measures can address
              governance failings and the socioeconomic grievances that often
              lie behind extremism at a local level.
              <br /><br />
              Developing and implementing PVE development programming is not
              straightforward. For example, rebranding governance and
              development activities under the banner of PVE is not recommended.
              These programs have intrinsic value in and of themselves, and
              bannering them under PVE would entail unnecessary risk.
              <br /><br />
              Central to the development-PVE challenge is the familiar issue of
              the conceptual weakness of violent extremism. Even at the most
              basic level, all the key concepts are complex, contested and
              highly politicised. That terrorism, radicalisation and violent
              extremism are often used as synonyms is indicative of just how
              deep this problem runs.
              <br /><br />
              Obviously, it is difficult to discuss development solutions to
              problems and terms that are both poorly defined and often
              disputed. This conceptual problem filters down to programming.
              Preventing or countering violent extremism are often used as
              synonyms, and de facto programming can include just about
              anything.
              <br /><br />
              Another issue facing development practitioners is that the study
              of violent extremism is often very limited in scope, focusing
              primarily on immediate security issues. Research into wider root
              causes remains nascent. While academics and security analysts have
              studied the radicalisation of violent extremists at great length,
              less attention has been paid to the impact and reaction of
              societies to sustained acts of terrorism.
              <br /><br />
              This is oversight is important. The response of states to acts of
              violence is often an overreaction, and it is this overreaction
              that the terrorists seek from acts of terrorism in order to divide
              and polarise societies. Outcomes have often involved increases in
              executive power at the expense of the legislature and judiciary,
              restrictions of civil and political freedoms and gross violations
              of human rights and impunity perpetrated by increasingly powerful
              and often politicised security forces.
              <br /><br />
              The reaction or overreaction to acts of terror can create a cycle
              of radicalisation between governments, society and the media, and
              terrorists. A deepening cycle of violence and state repression
              that feeds back into a cycle of deepening violence through a range
              of violent extremism drivers. Schmid describes this process as
              “government radicalisation” :
              <br /><br />
              “[I]t is equally important to examine the role of state actors and
              their potential for radicalisation. The use of torture techniques
              and extra-judicial renditions in recent years has been a drastic
              departure from democratic rule of law procedures and international
              human rights standards. These are indicative of the fact that in a
              polarised political situation not only non-state actors but also
              state actors can radicalise”.

          <h2>Radicalisation and extremism: Child Abuse</h2>
          <details>
            <summary>
              Radicalisation is when someone starts to believe or support
              extreme views, and in some cases, then participates in terrorist
              groups or acts. It can be motivated by a range of factors,
              including ideologies, religious beliefs, political beliefs and
              prejudices against particular groups of people.
            </summary>
            <p>
              People may be radicalised in many different ways, and over
              different time frames from as little as a few days or hours, or it
              may take several years.
              <br /><br />
              Who is at risk?<br /><br />
              Anyone can be radicalised, but factors such as being easily
              influenced and impressionable make children and young people
              particularly vulnerable.
              <br /><br />
              Children who are at risk of radicalisation may have low
              self-esteem or be victims of bullying or discrimination. They may
              feel:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>isolated and lonely or wanting to belong</li>
              <li>
                unhappy about themselves and what others might think of them
              </li>
              <li>
                embarrassed or judged about their culture, gender, religion or
                race
              </li>
              <li>stressed or depressed</li>
              <li>
                fed up of being bullied or treated badly by other people or by
                society
              </li>
              <li>angry at other people or the government</li>
              <li>confused about what they are doing</li>
              <li>
                pressured to stand up for other people who are being oppressed
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              How does it happen?<br /><br />
              Radicalisation doesn’t happen overnight. It is a gradual process,
              so young people who are affected may not realise what’s happening.
              <br /><br />
              People can be radicalised by family members or friends, through
              direct contact with extremist groups, or through the internet.
              Extremist messages or membership of an extremist group can offer a
              sense of purpose, community and identity which may be appealing,
              especially if someone is experiencing challenges in their life.
              <br /><br />
              Teenagers can be at greater risk because they are more
              independent, exploring new things and pushing boundaries as they
              grow and discover more about their identity, faith and sense of
              belonging.
              <br /><br />
              Extremist groups often target young people via the internet and
              social media.
              <br /><br />
              The process may involve:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>being groomed online or in person</li>
              <li>exploitation, including sexual exploitation</li>
              <li>psychological manipulation</li>
              <li>
                exposure to violent material and other inappropriate information
              </li>
              <li>the risk of physical harm or death through extremist acts</li>
            </ul>
