          <h2>Inequality: A persisting challenge and its implications</h2>
          <details>
            <summary>
              While the wealth gap has narrowed globally, inequality within
              advanced economies has increased since the 1980s.Inequality is not
              a new phenomenon, but in recent years it has reemerged as a social
              and political flash point in advanced economies and beyond,
              stoking public dissatisfaction.
            </summary>
            <p>
              Perspectives about inequality—what it is, how it is evolving, and
              how to address it—are polarized. At times, even the data used to
              support arguments are contested.

              <br /><br />
              Growing inequality has left many people behind In Inequality: A
              persisting challenge and its implications, we provide a fact base
              to inform the discussion, drawing on a wide range of sources and
              ongoing McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research. We highlight
              different dimensions of inequality, such as inequality of wealth,
              of income, of consumption, and of opportunity, with a particular
              but not exclusive focus on the G-7 countries—Canada, France,
              Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United
              States—which in many ways are at the epicenter of the challenges
              around inequality.
              <br /><br />
              Viewed from a broad perspective, inequality is in decline as
              developing economies led by China and India have considerably
              narrowed the gap in wealth and income with richer countries since
              the 1980s. Higher-income countries’ share of global wealth fell
              from 80 percent in 2000 to 71 percent in 2014, while the wealth
              share of middle-income countries such as Indonesia and Mexico rose
              from 14 percent to 22 percent.
              <br /><br />
              Inequality within many advanced countries is moving in the
              opposite direction from the global trend of declining inequality
              between countries. In G-7 economies and across many (but not all)
              advanced economies, wealth and income inequality in general has
              been rising since the 1980s.
              <br /><br />
              It is important to provide nuance and context to this blanket
              statement. Within inequality, there is a hierarchy of sorts: the
              distribution of wealth among the population is substantially more
              unequal than the distribution of income, which in turn is more
              unequal than the distribution of consumption, based on consumption
              expenditure. For example, in 2014, the wealthiest 1 percent of
              people in G-7 countries owned about 27 percent of the total
              wealth. That was double the 13 percent share of total income that
              went to the top 1 percent of income earners in the same countries
              that year.

          <h2>Six policies to reduce economic inequality</h2>
          <details>
            <summary>
              Here are six ways to minimize the rising economic inequality
              prevalent in the United States. Haas Institute Director John
              Powell discusses why these policies will work in slowing the
              growth in inequality.
            </summary>
            <p>
              1. Increase the minimum wage. Research shows that higher wages for
              the lowest-paid workers has the potential to help nearly 4.6
              million people out of poverty and add approximately $2 billion to
              the nation's overall real income. Additionally, increasing the
              minimum wage does not hurt employment nor does it retard economic
              growth.<br /><br />

              2. Expand the Earned Income Tax. In recent years, the EITC has
              been shown to have a positive impact on families, lifting roughly
              4.7 million children above the poverty line on an annual basis.
              Increases in the EITC can pull more children out of poverty while
              providing more economic support for the working poor, especially
              single parents entering the workforce.
              <br /><br />
              3. Build assets for working families. Policies that encourage
              higher savings rates and lower the cost of building assets for
              working and middle class households can provide better economic
              security for struggling families. New programs that automatically
              enroll workers in retirement plans and provide a savings credit or
              a federal match for retirement savings accounts could help
              lower-income households build wealth. Access to fair, low-cost
              financial services and home ownership are also important pathways
              to wealth.<br /><br />

              4. Invest in education. Differences in early education and school
              quality are the most important components contributing to
              persistent inequality across generations. Investments in
              education, beginning in early childhood with programs like Head
              Start and Universal Pre-K, can increase economic mobility,
              contribute to increased productivity and decrease inequality.
              <br /><br />
              5. Make the tax code more progressive. It is a great irony that
              tax rates for those at the top have been declining even as their
              share of income and wealth has increased dramatically. The data
              show we have created bad tax policy by giving capital gains --
              profits from the sale of property or investments -- special
              privileges in our country's tax code; privileges that give
              investment income more value than actual work. Capital gains tax
              rates must be adjusted so that they are in line with income tax
              rates. Savings incentives structured as refundable tax credits,
              which treat every dollar saved equally, can provide equal benefits
              for lower-income families.
              <br /><br />
              6. End residential segregation. Higher levels of racial
              residential segregation within a metropolitan region are strongly
              correlated with significantly reduced levels of intergenerational
              upward mobility for all residents of that area. Segregation by
              income, particularly the isolation of low-income households, also
              correlates with significantly reduced levels of upward mobility.
              Eliminating residential segregation by income and race can boost
              economic mobility for all.
