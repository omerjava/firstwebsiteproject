          <h2>Why do so many people want to leave Eritrea for Europe?</h2>
          <details>
            <summary
              >After Syria, Eritrea provides the second largest number of people
              looking to migrate to Europe. One in 10 of all prospective
              migrants to Europe are Eritrean, and the UN estimates around 4,000
              people leave the country every month.</summary
            >
            <p>
              Most say they are fleeing military service, but the Eritrean
              government maintains those who leave are economic migrants.
              <br /><br />
              A 20-year-old man from Eritrea is nursing serious leg wounds after
              being shot twice by people he says were Eritrean soldiers
              stationed near the border with Ethiopia.
              <br /><br />
              "Even after I fell down, I could hear the bullets whizzing past
              me," Weldab tells me from a clinic bed in Mai-Aini refugee camp in
              Ethiopia.
              <br /><br />
              "I was lucky that I escaped. There were 10 of us in total; I don't
              know what happened to the rest of my friends."
              <br /><br />
              This was the young man's second attempt to leave his homeland.
              <br /><br />
              He walked for most of the journey. Many of the refugees I met
              walked, mostly at night to avoid being detected.
              <br /><br />
              Some told me they paid traffickers between $100 and $700 (£65 and
              £450) to show them the way.
              <br /><br />
              Others said that relatives in Europe have been known to pay the
              traffickers directly.
              <br /><br />
              They would be taken by car part of the way and then shown the
              "safest" route by foot.
              <br /><br />
              Although there is no war or famine in Eritrea, it accounts for the
              second largest number of asylum-seekers arriving in Europe, after
              Syria.
              <br /><br />
              Weldab, who did not want to give his full name, had paid a fee to
              go to Europe the first time he tried to flee.
              <br /><br />
              But it went wrong at the border with Sudan, when he was arrested
              on the Eritrean side and spent three weeks in police cells.
              <br /><br />
              He told me that back home he only dreamt of two things: Playing
              football and going abroad - because he wants to avoid being
              conscripted into the army.
              <br /><br />
              The UN has witnessed a huge rise in the number of people crossing
              from Eritrea into Ethiopia in May and June.
              <br /><br />
              In just two days I saw nearly 500 refugees coming through dozens
              of illegal routes on the heavily guarded border.
              <br /><br />
              Like Weldab, most are young people wanting to avoid conscription,
              which is compulsory after finishing school for both men and women.
              <br /><br />
              It is supposed to last 18 months, but if not picked to continue
              their studies after this time - people can be forced to stay in
              the army until their 40s.

          <h2>The critical challenges of migration and displacement</h2>
          <details>
            <summary
              >While worldwide more than 250 million people live outside their
              home country, it is the estimated 65 million people who have been
              displaced by violence and conflict and those who are forced by
              other circumstances to choose irregular pathways of migration
              often outside legal frameworks foreseen for migration that
              represent a population of particular concern.</summary
            >
            <p>
              Of the 65 million people displaced by violence and war, just over
              20 million are refugees, while the remaining majority are
              displaced in their own countries, often more than once.
              <br /><br />
              Mexico and Central America, is no exception. One of the major
              flows of migrants happens right here and in particular in the
              Northern Triangle. The link between the root causes, the basic
              drivers and actual migration are rather complex; migration happens
              due to a series of factors and mixed migration happens as a
              consequence of inequalities in welfare and security and often
              happens in more than one way.
              <br /><br />
              Often, policies trying to reduce migration have an adverse effect.
              Migration flows, displacements by violence and other pressures on
              a dignified life, are creating vulnerabilities of great concern
              for the ICRC and the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement as a whole.
              ICRC's mandate is to protect and assist people affected by armed
              conflict and other situations of violence. People being forced to
              move by violence and insecurity – be it related to armed conflict
              or other drivers of violence – is a critical humanitarian
              priority.
